WHEELS
  "TT Motor" encoder and wheel parameters

  Motors have optical encoders, emitting light through a disk with 20 slots.
  Wheel size: 65x27mm , 204.2mm circle length.
  
  20 slots, 40 state changes per full revolution.
  40 state changes = 204.2mm traveled
  1 state change = (204.2 / 40) = 5.1mm

  100 state changes = 2.5 full revolutions = 51.5 cm
  200 state changes = 5 full revolutions = 103 cm
