WHEELS
  "TT Motor" encoder and wheel parameters

  Motors have optical encoders, emitting light through a disk with 20 slots.
  Wheel size: 65x27mm , 204.2mm circle length.
  
  20 slots, 40 state changes per full revolution.
  40 state changes = 204.2mm traveled
  1 state change = (204.2 / 40) = 5.1mm

  100 state changes = 2.5 full revolutions = 51.5 cm
  200 state changes = 5 full revolutions = 103 cm


Connectivity: ESP 8266 with https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link v 3.0.14 configured for my WLAN.

Vx_max = 0.5 m/s
Vx_min = 0.2 m/s
V_rot_max = 0.8 rad/s
V_rot_min = 0.6 rad/s
Acc_max = 1 m/s*s
Acc_rot = 1 rad/s*s
